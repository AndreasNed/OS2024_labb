Good placing credentials in .env-file 
and ignore together with .gitignore

= = CSS = =
Good use of CSS-grids and Flexbox
Good use of media queries

Be careful to select by tagname.
The css is not isolated to components
whith the current project setup.
Prefer the usage of class-names.
(form.css)

= = React = =
Good use of lifecycle-methods like shouldComponentUpdate

Prefer to use of functional components when a component
only return jsx-elements and have no need for state.
(myHeader.js)

= = General JavaScript ==
Good use of async/await
Good use of spread operator (...) to make 
imutable changes to objects

Good structure of using utils (utils.js)

Many complexed features has been created with 
an advanced usage of JavaScript. 
Very good job !!
